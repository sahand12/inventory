                    <p class="item-box-body">With operators seeking to extract more hydrocarbons from reservoirs than in the past, the need for optimizing production has become more than an option; it is a necessity. To address this need, <strong>VGN Energy has developed a systematic optimization cycle</strong> that provides the tools and knowledge clients need to proactively increase production and reduce costs for wells in all conditions.

                    <p class="item-box-body">In todayâ€™s complex drilling and producing environments, wells must be designed, constructed, and maintained to <strong>safely contain and control the flow of liquids and gases into or out of the well</strong>. Our well integrity management expertise provides the process for maintaining the integrity of the well throughout its life.

                    <p class="item-box-body">Defining an optimal completion design and determining well placement are the key objectives of the field development planning phase. The challenges are clear: Operators need to <strong>identify sweet spots for landing laterals</strong>, <strong>manage completion costs</strong>, and <strong>understand variability of production between stages and across multiple wells</strong>, while managing risks without adversely impacting the field operations.
